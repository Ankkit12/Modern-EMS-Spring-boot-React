🚀 Employee Management System (Full-Stack)

A full-stack Employee Management System built using Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT Authentication, React, MySQL, and Thymeleaf.

This project evolved from a basic CRUD system into a secure, production-style full-stack application with stateless authentication and role-based access control.

✨ Features
🧑‍💼 Employee Management
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) employees
- Search employees by keyword
- Pagination & Sorting
- RESTful API architecture
  
🔐 Security & Authentication
- Spring Security integration
- JDBC-based authentication with MySQL
- Role-Based Access Control (ADMIN / MANAGER / EMPLOYEE)
- JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication
- Stateless authentication using Bearer tokens

💡 Example:

Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

🎨 Frontend (React)
- Login page with JWT authentication
- Dashboard UI
- Employee management interface
- Integration with secure backend APIs
- Responsive and modern UI
  
📘 API Documentation
- Swagger / OpenAPI for API testing and documentation

⚠️ Exception Handling
- Global exception handling for clean API responses
  
🛠 Tech Stack

Backend:

- Java
- Spring Boot

📡 REST API Endpoints
Employee APIs
- GET /v1/employee
- GET /v1/employee/{id}
- POST /v1/employee
- PUT /v1/employee/{id}
- DELETE /v1/employee/{id}

Search & Pagination
- GET /v1/employee/search?keyword={keyword}
- GET /v1/employee/page?page=0&size=5

Authentication
- POST /auth/login

🔐 Security Flow
1. User logs in using credentials (JDBC + MySQL)
2. Spring Security validates user
3. JWT token is generated on successful authentication4
4. Frontend stores token
5.All protected APIs require:

Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

👨‍💻 Demo Credentials (if enabled)

ADMIN

Username: susan
Password: fun123

USER

Username: john
Password: fun123
